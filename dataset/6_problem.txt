Takahashi, a pastry chef at ABC Confiserie, has decided to make cakes to celebrate AtCoder Beginner Contest 200.

A cake made by Takahashi has three parameters: beauty, taste, and popularity, each of which is represented by an integer between 1 and N (inclusive).

He has made a cake of beauty i, taste j, and popularity k for every triple (i,j,k) (1≤i,j,k≤N).
Then, he has arranged these N^3 cakes in a row, as follows:

The cakes are in ascending order of sum of beauty, taste, and popularity from left to right.
For two cakes with the same sum of beauty, taste, and popularity, the cake with the smaller beauty is to the left.
For two cakes with the same sum and the same beauty, the cake with the smaller taste is to the left.
Find the beauty, taste, and popularity of the 
K-th cake from the left.
