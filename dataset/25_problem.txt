We have a large square grid with H rows and W columns. 
Iroha is now standing in the top-left cell. She will repeat going right or down to the adjacent cell, until she reaches the bottom-right cell.

However, she cannot enter the cells in the intersection of the bottom A rows and the leftmost B columns. 
(That is, there are AÃ—B forbidden cells.) There is no restriction on entering the other cells.

Find the number of ways she can travel to the bottom-right cell.

Since this number can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7.
