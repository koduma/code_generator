Takahashi has forgotten his PIN. 
The PIN is a four-digit string consisting of 0, 1, …, 9, and may begin with a 0.

For each digit 0 through 9, Takahashi remembers the following fact, represented by a 10-character string S0S1…S9:

if Si is o: he is certain that the PIN contained the digit i;
if Si is x: he is certain that the PIN did not contain the digit i;
if Si is ?: he is not sure whether the PIN contained the digit i.
How many strings are there that could be Takahashi's PIN?
