We have a string S consisting of 0, 1, and ?. Let T be the concatenation of K copies of S.
By replacing each ? in T with 0 or 1, we can obtain 2^Kq strings, where q is the number of ?s in S.
Solve the problem below for each of these strings and find the sum of all the answers, modulo (10^9+7).

Let T′ be the string obtained by replacing ? in T. 
We will repeatedly do the operation below to make all the characters in T the same. At least how many operations are needed for this?

Choose integers l and r such that 1≤l≤r≤∣T′∣, and invert the l-th through r-th characters of T: from 0 and 1 and vice versa.
